This folder contains support code for the OpenCTD. In Arduino Libraries, you will find compressed folders for all of the libraries that are required to run the OpenCTD software. These include:

- [Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library.zip](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/blob/master/OpenCTD_Feather_Adalogger/Support%20Code/Arduino%20Libraries/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library.zip) which allows you to communicate with the temperature sensor array
- [MS5803_14.zip](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/blob/master/OpenCTD_Feather_Adalogger/Support%20Code/Arduino%20Libraries/MS5803_14.zip) which supports the 14-bar pressure sensors
- [OneWire.zip](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/blob/master/OpenCTD_Feather_Adalogger/Support%20Code/Arduino%20Libraries/OneWire.zip) which allows you to control the Dallas 1-wire protocol family of devices
- [RTClib.zip](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/blob/master/OpenCTD_Feather_Adalogger/Support%20Code/Arduino%20Libraries/RTClib.zip) which drives the real-time clock
- [SoftwareSerial.zip](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/blob/master/OpenCTD_Feather_Adalogger/Support%20Code/Arduino%20Libraries/SoftwareSerial.zip) which enables the serial monitor on the Adafruit Adalogger

In addition, you will find the [Serial_for_EC_Calibration_m0.ino](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/blob/master/OpenCTD_Feather_Adalogger/Support%20Code/Serial_for_EC_Calibration_m0.ino) Arduino code, which allows you to calibrate the OpenCTD's conductivity circuit.

Please reference the [OpenCTD Construction and Operation Manual](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/blob/master/OpenCTD_Feather_Adalogger/OpenCTD_ConstructionOperation.pdf) for a full description of its function and use.
